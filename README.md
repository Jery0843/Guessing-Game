# Guessing Game

A simple, interactive console-based game where players guess a randomly selected number within a specified range. The game features multiple difficulty levels, providing hints and tracking the number of attempts a player makes.

## Features

- **Multiple Difficulty Levels**: Choose between easy, medium, and hard difficulty levels, each with different ranges of numbers.
- **Hints**: Receive hints based on your guesses to help guide you to the correct answer.
- **Performance Tracking**: The game tracks your attempts and the time taken to guess the number correctly.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x

## Setup

No additional setup or dependencies are required. Ensure you have Python 3 installed on your system.

## How to Play

1. **Start the Game**: Run the game script in your terminal or command prompt.
2. **Select Difficulty**: At the start of the game, choose your desired difficulty level by typing `easy`, `medium`, or `hard`. For a more tailored challenge, select `custom` and specify your own range and maximum number of attempts.
3. **Make Your Guess**: Enter your guess at the prompt. The game will tell you if your guess is too high or too low, and provide hints to help you narrow down the correct number.
4. **Repeat**: Continue guessing until you find the correct number or run out of attempts.

## Difficulty Levels

- **Easy**: The number range is between 1 and 100.
- **Medium**: The number range is between 1 and 200.
- **Hard**: The number range is between 1 and 500.

## Hints

Hints are provided to indicate how close your guess is to the target number, with specific messages indicating the temperature of your guess relative to the target number.

## Ending the Game

The game concludes once you correctly guess the number or exhaust your allotted attempts. At the end of each game, you'll be given the option to play again or exit. Your performance statistics, including the average time and attempts per game, are displayed upon exiting.
